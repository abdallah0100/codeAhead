            <p>CodeAhead is a platform that is built to be a base for all developers of all levels, enabling them to connect to each other
in a mutual forum that is home for both experienced developers, juniors or even people that are intersted in this field alike.<br /> <br />

Providing a forum that is built to share snippets of intersting plugins, get help to fix an error that you faced, show-off your accomplishments,
share work experiences or even get services from other developers for a price that is supervised by designated members to maintain a fair trade,
respecting the effort it takes to be accomplished and a reasonable price for the requester. <br /><br />

All of these are our contribution to get a thriving community of international developers that aims to share knowledge, learn from others and potentially
a place to start your new business!
